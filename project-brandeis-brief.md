# Project Brandeis

## Goal Statement
To build a resident focused, legally recognized government identity provider platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable equitable and inclusive government service access, efficiency and data analytics for the modern digital age, that respects the data sharing preferences of the resident.

This solves several problems:
* Opens access to government services, for all residents of the area
* Creates an accessible modern paper-optional system for identification (eg homeless, immigrants, digital natives)
* Distributes storage of the credentials, ensuring resilience and longevity
* Respects residents preferences on data sharing
* Enables secure programmatic access to shared data for analysis
* Shareable credential system between municipal partners, nonprofits and businesses

## Real World Service Examples
* Resident ID system   
* Resident data standardization   
* Resident data security   
* Publicly verifiable surveys and voting
* Government service adoption & usage
* Instant city census

## Intended Results
* The project will lead to the creation of a modern, Metro Council legislated ID system for all residents of Louisville & Jefferson County.

* The project will enable resident access to critical city resources & programs, enabling access to all residents to the ideals of a Compassionate City. Initial service offerings could be as follows:
        - Residency (IDNYC, CityKey, DC One)   
        - Mobility/Transit (DC One)   
        - Business or Permit Licenses (CityKey)   
        - Property Claims (CityKey)   
        - Property Registration   
        - Pet Registration (CityKey)   
        - Community services (IDNYC)   
        - Financial services (IDNYC)   

* The project will create, maintain, and manage identity information for principals while providing authentication services to relying party applications within a federation or distributed blockchain network.

## Prework & Evidence:
In the United States, a city (or municipal) identification card is a form of identification card issued by a municipality, such as a city, rather than a state or federal government. Under federal law, cities may issue their own identification cards as they see fit, and do not have to consider the immigration or criminal status of an applicant before doing so. Cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC and others have already implemented some form of municipal ID system, with many exploring adopting blockchain technology to support them.

New Haven, Connecticut issued the first municipal identification cards in the United States, the Elm City Resident Card, in 2007.[2] On January 15, 2009, the city/county of San Francisco launched the SF City ID Card, a municipal identification card program modeled after New Haven's.[3] Other cities that issue identification cards include Asbury Park, New Jersey,[4] and Washington, D.C. (DC One Card).[5] In Mercer County, New Jersey, a community ID card is being issued by a local non profit organization with the endorsement of various law enforcement agencies.

According to the UN 2020 Identity report, 1.1 billion people in the world do not have a verified identity, in the United States alone, 11% percent of Americans do not have a government issued id card. A self-sovereign digital identity benefits both individuals and organizations. By removing the need to store personal data locally, our solution creates permissioned access to data, is cost effective by using a single verification process and ensures the interoperability with government agencies. By leveraging the increased trust in mobile phones, all residents, including those that previously didn't qualify for a government ID, will have access to government services and maximizes inclusion with an option to integrate with financial service providers or health care services in the future. Government supported inclusion initiatives and technological innovations are key drivers for the proliferation of Digital ID's. Physical ID cards will be used as an off-chain extension of the Digital ID, as businesses and the public become comfortable with using mobile based Digital ID systems. (uPort with CityKey Summary)

## Technical Resources

* Ethereum, and uPort technology to connect the physical manifestation of the ID system, to the digital.

  - uPort:
  uPort returns ownership of identity to the individual. uPort's open identity system allows users to register their own identity on Ethereum, send and request credentials, sign transactions, and securely manage keys & data.

New York:
New York City residents are now able to sign up for IDNYC â€“ a government-issued identification card that is available to all City residents age 14 and older. Immigration status does not matter. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this initiative in his State of the City address in January 2014 and less than one year later proudly launched the largest municipal identification card program in the nation.
