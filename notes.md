Despite funding cut threats from the Trump administration, Chicago is forging ahead with plans for a municipal ID program that would protect the personal data of immigrants from authorities and allow new access to city services and facilities.

On Monday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and City Clerk Anna Valencia began soliciting technology companies to build a platform for municipal ID cards the city plans to begin rolling out later this year. The program makes Chicago part of a national trend among sanctuary cities to design identification systems that shield the personal data of undocumented residents and prevent possible deportation. New York, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco are a few of the sanctuary cities that have already implemented similar city ID programs, and with Chicago’s entry, the city hopes the system will be a gateway for its immigrant families.

In the last decade, a growing number of US cities have implemented municipal identification cards (IDs). Both advocates and critics call municipal IDs “documenting the undocumented.”[1] IDs enable residents to access buildings and services, but are issued by municipalities rather than states.

Conceptually, municipal IDs —and other state and local measures to regularize the lives of the unauthorized and to prevent deportations — derive from the 1980s “sanctuary city” movement.[2] In 1979, Los Angeles was the first city to instruct local police not to determine the immigration status of residents.[3] In the 2000s, interfaith leaders founded the “New Sanctuary Movement” to protest US immigration enforcement policy.[4]

In the United States, a city (or municipal) identification card is a form of identification card issued by a municipality, such as a city, rather than a state or federal government. Under federal law, cities may issue their own identification cards as they see fit, and do not have to consider the immigration or criminal status of an applicant before doing so.[1] New Haven, Connecticut issued the first municipal identification cards in the United States, the Elm City Resident Card, in 2007.[2] On January 15, 2009, the city/county of San Francisco launched the SF City ID Card, a municipal identification card program modeled after New Haven's.[3] Other cities that issue identification cards include Asbury Park, New Jersey,[4] and Washington, D.C. (DC One Card).[5] In Mercer County, New Jersey, a community ID card is being issued by a local non profit organization with the endorsement of various law enforcement agencies.





New York City residents are now able to sign up for IDNYC – a government-issued identification card that is available to all City residents age 14 and older. Immigration status does not matter. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this initiative in his State of the City address in January 2014 and less than one year later proudly launched the largest municipal identification card program in the nation.

PHILADELPHIA – Today, the City of Philadelphia has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) seeking a third-party vendor to support development and implementation of a Municipal Identification Card (“Municipal ID”) Program.

Responses to this RFP will assess the feasibility of implementing a municipal ID program in Philadelphia. Factors considered will include cost, implementation logistics, privacy protections and long-term sustainability.  The RFP can be viewed HERE. The Mayor’s Office, Managing Director’s Office, and Office of Immigrant Affairs are managing the RFP process.
These programs have shown success in promoting civic participation, and supporting local commerce, particularly among populations such as the elderly, returning citizens, undocumented immigrants, LGBTQ, people who are homeless, and survivors of domestic violence.  New York, NY; Detroit, MI; Newark, NJ; and San Francisco, CA, have successfully implemented municipal ID programs.
